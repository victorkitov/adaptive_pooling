Source code of experiments with adaptive pooling, allowing to 
* automatically combine average and max poolings instead of taking only one of them.
* automatically select the area over which max pooling is applied.

Presented pooling types lead to accuracy improvement on different image classification datasets due to their higher flexibility.

Polling combination is a perspective technique, resembling enesemble learning, where the forecasts are made by several models simultaneously and combined together instead of relying only on single model.
